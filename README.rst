==================================
Open source UTV/tractor
==================================



Introduction
=====================

As a fulltime off-grid living non-youtuber I challenged many difficulties with moving stuff around in the past.
People were saying "buy a tractor". I was always making fun of that and saying "oh that's boring, I will make one".
I also want to graze sheep in the near future...

Eventually the first came true and I am starting considering actually building *something*, however:

- as a lazy and no-dig gardener/future farmer, I have no need to plough anything. Common small tractors are
  usually optimized for this purpose.
- on the other hand, a lot of mowing and mulching work need to be done
- to bootstrap an offgrid dwelling I need to move a lot of stuff to locations where conventional cars can't get
  until a suitable road is built. Then it needs to be serviced continuously.
- most of the work is done during the summer, however some snow plowing has to be done during winter
- as an offgrider I am (and probably will be) living on a hillside or in a mountaineous region

As a result, a special UTV (utility task/terrain vehicle) is much better suited for my needs.


Disclaimer
===================

I don't really know what I am doing. Not even remotely. As a programer and EE, I have a slightly curved
perception of the real world and you may get hurt if you follow my advice or any information contained here.


What is this build about
==============================

This repository will contain sources to build/assemble an UTV capable of:

- electro-hydrostatic drivetrain with selectable AWD/FWD/RWD, individual wheel torque control and "lockers"
- about 10 kWh LiFePO4 accumulator
- at least 25 km range
- maximum 12 km/h in low-range AWD, 25 km/h in high-range FWD/RWD
- very low center of gravity to allow hillside/slope driving
- fixed articulating suspension
- hydraulic power steering on both axles
- common UTV 25x10-R12 tires
- front and rear 3 point hitch
- weight under 1000 kg
- towing capability 2000 kg minimum
- optional trailer power delivery and brakes
- optional cab
- optional full remote control
- optional front loader


Components
======================

Some parts of the UTV are contained in their respective repositories because of their complexity
or possibility to be reused in other projects.
